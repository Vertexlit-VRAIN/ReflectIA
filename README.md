# CritiCat

CritiCat is an AI-powered image analysis tool that provides detailed feedback for various image classifications, such as editorial content and social media posts.

## Description

This application allows users to upload multiple images, classify them, and receive an in-depth analysis generated by an AI. The analysis helps users understand the strengths and weaknesses of their images, providing suggestions for improvement. The tool is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a simple interface for uploading and classifying images.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.10.x and `uv` installed. You can install the required dependencies using `uv`:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Configuration

To use the AI-powered analysis, you need to set up your Google API key.

1.  Obtain your API key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    ```

    Alternatively, you can set the environment variable directly in your terminal:

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    ```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

This will launch a Gradio interface in your web browser. You can then upload your images, select a classification for each image, and provide a general description. Once you're ready, click the "Analyze Images" button to get the AI-powered analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `main.py`: The main entry point of the application, containing the Gradio interface and event listeners.
- `ai_providers.py`: Contains the logic for interacting with the AI model to generate the image analysis.
- `config.py`: Configuration file for setting up the application, such as the maximum number of images allowed.
- `gradio_callbacks.py`: Contains the callback functions for the Gradio interface, such as updating UI elements and generating the AI response.
- `image_utils.py`: Utility functions for image processing and manipulation.
- `prompts/`: A directory containing the prompts used to guide the AI model's analysis.
- `static/`: A directory for static files, such as CSS stylesheets.
- `examples/`: A directory with example images for testing the application.

### Prompts

The `prompts` directory contains the following files, which are used to guide the AI model's analysis:

- `prompt_conversation.txt`: This prompt is used to guide the AI in a conversational tutoring and feedback mode. It helps the AI act as a mentor, providing feedback, guidance, and small exercises in response to the user’s questions or designs.
- `prompt_design.txt`: This prompt is used for a general visual design analysis. It guides the AI to analyze any input image and provide a structured, detailed diagnosis of what is happening in the design, how it works, and where issues appear.
- `prompt_magazine.txt`: This prompt is used for analyzing magazine and editorial designs. It guides the AI to analyze any magazine element and provide a structured, detailed diagnosis.
- `prompt_magazine_full.txt`: A more comprehensive version of the magazine prompt, this file guides the AI to evaluate a magazine project (cover and interior pages/spreads) using both general and editorial-specific design criteria. The "full" version incorporates general design principles as well as platform-specific best practices.
- `prompt_social.txt`: This prompt is used for analyzing social media posts. It guides the AI to analyze any social media asset and provide a structured, detailed diagnosis.
- `prompt_social_full.txt`: A more comprehensive version of the social media prompt, this file guides the AI to evaluate a campaign consisting of Instagram and Twitter/X posts, as well as a newsletter, using both general and platform-specific design criteria. The "full" version incorporates general design principles as well as platform-specific best practices.
